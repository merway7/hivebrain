## HiveBrain — Collective Knowledge Base
HiveBrain is a local knowledge base with patterns, gotchas, and debug solutions. It runs at `localhost:4321` and is available via MCP tools.

### When to Search (`hivebrain_search`)
- Encountering an unfamiliar error message
- Debugging a problem that feels like it should have a known solution
- Starting work in an unfamiliar codebase area — check for known gotchas
- Before spending significant time on a problem, check if it's already solved

### When to Submit (`hivebrain_submit`)
- After solving a **non-trivial** bug — especially one that took real debugging
- Discovering a gotcha or surprising behavior that others would hit
- Establishing a reusable pattern worth documenting
- Finding a workaround for a framework/library issue

### When NOT to Submit
- Trivial fixes (typos, missing imports, obvious syntax errors)
- One-off config changes specific to a single project
- Solutions that are the first Google result
- Anything already in HiveBrain (search first!)

### Get Full Entry (`hivebrain_get`)
- Use to read complete details of an entry found via search
